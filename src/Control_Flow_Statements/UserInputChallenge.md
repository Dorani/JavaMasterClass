#### User Input Challenge:

- Read 10 numbers from the console entered by the user and print the sum of those numbers.
- Create a Scanner like we did in the previous video.
    - Use the hasNextInt() method from the scanner to check if the user has entered an int value.
    - If hasNextInt() returns false, print the message ÅgInvalid NumberÅh. Continue reading until you have read 10 numbers.
    - Use the nextInt() method to get the number and add it to the sum.
    - Before the user enters each number, print the message ÅgEnter number #x:Åh where x represents the count, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.


    -For example, the first message printed to the user would be ÅgEnter number #1:Åh, the next ÅgEnter number #2: Åh, and so on.



#### Hint: 
- Use a while loop.
- Use a counter variable for counting valid numbers.
- Close the scanner after you donÅft need it anymore.
- Create a project with the name ReadingUserInputChallenge.
