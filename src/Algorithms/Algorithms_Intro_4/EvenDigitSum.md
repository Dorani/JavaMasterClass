#### Even Digit Sum:

Write a method **named getEvenDigitSum** with _one parameter_ of **type int called number**.

The method _should return the sum_ of the **even digits** within the number.

If the _number is negative_, the method should **return -1** to indicate an invalid value.


EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

* getEvenDigitSum(123456789); → should return 20 since 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20

* getEvenDigitSum(252); → should return 4 since 2 + 2 = 4

* getEvenDigitSum(-22); → should return -1 since the number is negative


* **NOTE:** The method getEvenDigitSum should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

* **NOTE:** Do not add a main method to the solution code.
